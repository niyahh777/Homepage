<div class="heading"> My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. What could yours be? By Laurel Schwulst</div>
<div class="journal1"> “What is a website?”  was informative and intriguing. It answers the question of what a website is in detail,and other things such as what an ip,or server is. Learning what these are and their purposes is helpful. The section What can a website be ?  was interesting to read because it puts you in the perspective of thinking of a website as a room. Rooms can be someone's place of comfort. The other metaphors were interesting as well. Each gives you a different way to think about your website. This reading was intriguing and thought provoking.</div>

<div class="heading2">Rant About Technology By Ursula K. Le Guin</div>

<div class="journal2">After reading “A Rant 
About Technology” I have a broader understanding of what technology can be. When I usually think about what technology is, most times I think of something like a phone or computer. But reading that “the word is consistently misused to mean only the enormously complex and specialised technologies of the past few decades, supported by massive exploitation both of natural and human resources” .Furthermore, I like the comparisons that were used, because it makes you think about hi tech vs technology. “That's the neat thing about technologies. They're what we can learn to do” ending stuck with me because we truly do learn new things everyday.</div>

<div class="heading3">A Handmade Web By J.R Carpenter</div>
<div class="journal3">
“A Handmade Web” informed me thoroughly on what handmade webdesign is. Learning briefly about the beginnings of handmade web pages was interesting,especially considering how websites are developed now and the aesthetic of them. “These are not artifacts of a dead web but rather, signposts on a map of a living web pointing to a web as it once was, a web in progress, a web in the making”. Reading the essay along with the sources provided gave deeper insight into the history of early web development.

<div class="heading4">Hello World! By Taeyoon Choi</div>
<div class="journal4">I enjoyed reading Hello World! By Taeyoon Choi. The drawings brought were a great addition to Choi’s journey .The reader walks through the story of someone who's understanding the principles of computation and electricity through tinkering with circuits. I think it's cool this expedition began because Choi didnt know how a computer really works, and begans to build one to learn. Something that stood out to me was “The first computers were human”. When I saw that I related it to the other readings and the conversation of Web designing. “Commercial incentives drove corporations to establish proprietary ecosystems' ' proprietary ecosytem was discussed in class and it's also a word I seen used briefly in the reading “A Handmade Web' ' by J.r Carpernter. Lastly The comparison between cities and computers was really thought provoking, and stuck with me after reading this story. </div>
