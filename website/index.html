<p>The hand has become <i>increasingly less present</i> in the web as we know it today. Websites are largely automated or built from templates, and the knowledge of how to make a website is relegated to a select few. It has only grown easier to learn how to make websites, but the perceived requirements and expectations for a website have become so convoluted and arcane that many avoid the subject. This course seeks to dispel these ideas and will emphasize the <b>hand-quality</b> of websites by developing an understanding of the best practices, language, history, and present context of the web. We will examine the space of the web at large and explore and challenge what a website is and can be with the hopes of reclaiming an important creative space.

<p>websites we’ll make may be small, but their hearts will be big.</p> 
    
<p>first part of the class will be technically focused. It will be comprised of a series of lessons, readings, workshops, and small projects to develop familiarity and confidence with the language of the web. We’ll focus on the basic languages of web development: HTML, CSS, and a little Javascript. This class is designed for students with no programming experience at all, but should be useful to any skill level. The second part of class will be focused on a larger project website.</p>
